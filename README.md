## Instructions

The  project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. This was provided on the Udacity platform.

Most of the functionality is written in JavaScript, some parts in jQuery and can be found in the app.js file.
I sorted the code according to the methods, starting with variables, then functions and then calling the functions.
The game is in a basic version but fulfills all requirements from Udacity.
